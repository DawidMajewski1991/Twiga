                    <h3 class="program__title">How to get involved</h3>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        Like with other programs of ours, you may decide either to take a more permanent role to support this program or just take a more loose role that won’t bind you that much. Either way, we still appreciate the support you decide provide us with.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="program__title">Becoming a Friend Family Program Mediator</h3>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        A Friend program Mediator is a person who either provides support to a friend family of Twiga Vision themselves or looks for sponsors who can support families this way. In order for you to become a Sponsorship Mediator, you just need to think of the amount commitment you want to make. It is always advisable that you take some time to think about it before deciding. Supporting a family this way for three years is a big commitment, but on the other hand is a big blessing to do such kind act. After that think of whether you want to do sponsorship for one family, or you want to find sponsors for more than one family. When you are clear of what you want to do, you contact Twiga Vision in Tanzania or through our already existing Sponsorship Mediators and inform them about your intension to become a Sponsorship Mediator. They will guide you through and give you a list of families in need of support. Then you can start straight away!
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="program__title">One-time donation</h3>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        You may not want to become a Sponsorship Mediator, but would like to support the families in another way like buying food for them of sponsoring a child from that family or medical treatment. That is also an option.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="program__title">Providing business capital to finishing families</h3>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        Like we have said above, at some point this families need to be independent before the end of three years. One way these families can get business capital is from donations of well wishers. You can also help a business start; we will play our part by making sure the business becomes sustainable. And the family is independent by the end of the time.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="program__title">Joining business training sessions</h3>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        this particular important as it motivates the participants to continue attending. When you join them, you may want to share experience or ideas with them this will definitely make them so motivated to continue coming. This is especially possible for current volunteers.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="program__title">Volunteer with us</h3>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        another way you can support us, is choosing us as your volunteering destination. Coming to volunteer with us, either directly or coming through our partner organizations, it doesn’t really matter, is another great way of supporting us. Volunteers have always been the backbone of our organization’s progress. We expect our volunteers to have fundraised a bit before they come. This is for both their stay and for their projects. For those interested, and would like to come to us directly, we can talk about their volunteering before they come. But for those coming through our partner organizations, everything is organized other there
