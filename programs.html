                    <p class="program__paragraph">In Tanzania’s urban areas, there are many cases where people find themselves in such a situation that they are being kicked out of a house that has been their home for a long time, just because they have failed to pay rent. In most cases, according to the laws of Tanzania, the landlord/lady would give them one – three months of notice wanting them to leave. When the time is ripe, the landlord is entitled to take whatever action towards the tenant, including kicking them out of the house. This is when our program comes into play.</p>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                    We help people in this situation get a home for at least two years before they can be independent and stand on their own feet. We know that there are so many reasons leading to those situations. One is when a man abandons his family because of failure of providing basic needs to the family. In most cases, the woman is left with the children not knowing what to do and where to go.</p>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                    This situation is more difficult if the woman was previously made a mere house wife. Their money earning capacity is reduce to minimum because of such circumstances. This makes it difficult for them to provide for their family when the man leaves. Many women end up being prostitutes, while their children take to the street and turning into street children.</p>

                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        When we get case like this, we usually pay a visit to their current home where their being evacuated. We evaluate the overall situation and come up with a full narration of the situation on paper. Where possible, we ask to meet the landlord/lady to ask for grace period, if our request is accepted then we use the grace period to look for a sponsor who can pay rent for this poor family. We do this by sending the information to our Family Friend program patron/patroness. After receiving the information, our Family Friend program patron/patroness shares the news with their respective networks. When a sponsor is found our Family Friend program patron/patroness inform us, and we immediately inform the waiting family about the attainment of a sponsor. The sponsor is expected to pay 30 Euros every month for 3 years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        Just after identifying the family we invite the head of the family to our business training sessions, happening once every week. In this training they learn a lot of business concepts. What is a business, how to develop a business idea, market research, customer care and how to tackle competition in business. The continue doing this training even after getting a sponsor. This is to prepare them to start their own business as way of eventually becoming independent. In one and a half or two years time we want them to come up with a specific and realistic business plan. We expect them to use the knowledge that they will have learned during the business training sessions. When their business plans is evaluate to good, a process to find them capital starts. There are two major ways to get them business capital one is through a donation by a onetime donor just for that business idea turn into reality. The other way is by using one Take a Malaika microcredit scheme. If they qualify for a loan they then get one.
                    </p>
                    <p class="program__paragraph">
                        This time we take a responsibility of making sure the business stands stable. We offer the client advice and from time to time we pay them a visit to see how everything is going with the business. After two or two and half years we tell them that they should now be independent. This is end of our support to that family.
